# Streaming_replication_PostgreSQL
Setting up a master-slave PostgreSQL configuration in Virtual Machines (VMs) means creating a system where one PostgreSQL database server (the master) handles all the write operations, and one or more other servers (the slaves) replicate the data from the master to handle read operations.
